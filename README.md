### Hey there! 👋

I'm Lidija. I'm a writer who aligns user and business needs with language. I specialize as both a content designer and technical writer: I manage content throughout the entire product lifecycle. 
* I'm a **content designer** with experience in product content writing, product design, user research, content strategy, information architecture, and taxonomy audits. I design accessible in-app experiences with words.
* I'm a **technical writer** with experience drafting user guides, API documentation, internal documentation, and release notes. I excel in making technical concepts accessible through clear documentation.
